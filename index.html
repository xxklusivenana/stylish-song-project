    <h1>Yesterday</h1>

    <p>Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away</p>
    <p>Now it looks as though they're here to stay</p>
    <p>Oh, I believe in yesterday</p>
    
    <p>Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be</p>
    <p>There's a shadow hanging over me</p>
    <p>Oh, yesterday came suddenly</p>
    
    <p>Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say</p>
    <p>I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday</p>
